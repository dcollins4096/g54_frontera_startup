We are requesting \request\ on Frontera in order to do a performance study in
advance of our upcoming \emph{Pathways} request.  

The simulations that will be in the full proposal are part of an effort to
observe gravitational waves from the Big Bang.  Gravitational waves generated at
the beginning of the Universe leave an imprint in the polarization of the cosmic
microwave background (CMB).  The CMB is the oldest light observable in the
Universe, and gives us a snapshot of the its very early stages.
Measuring the polarization of the CMB will give us a measurement of
gravitational waves that were produced at the formation of the Universe.
Unfortunately, the dusty plasma in our own Milky Way also produces polarized
light that is brighter than the primordial signal.  Our simulations will study
the polarization properties of the light from the plasma in Milky Way type
galaxies.  Understanding this polarization is essential for its removal from
future measurements of the CMB.
