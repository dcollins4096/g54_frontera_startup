\caption{The request broken down by physics suite (first colums).  $N_Z$ is the
number of zones.  The number of cores per node will be 56, and $64^3$ zones per
grid will be used.  $\zeta$ is the performance of the code in zone-updates per
core-seconde, here estimated on \emph{Stampede 2}. $N_U=100$ is the number of
root grid updates.}
